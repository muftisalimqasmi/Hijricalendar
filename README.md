 This project provides a fast, lightweight Hijri calendar and date conversion system built on a hybrid calculation approach. The calendar loads instantly using local Umm al-Qura calendar data for most dates, while selectively performing online verification only when necessary to check Hijri month transitions (day 29). The project is designed as a static, client-side application and can be deployed easily using GitHub Pages, with no backend required.https://ummalquracalendar.org/
